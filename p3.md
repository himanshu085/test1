## 📌 Overview

This SOP outlines the creation, usage, and management of Python virtual environments. It includes troubleshooting steps and best practices for clean and effective virtual environment workflows.

---

## 💡 What is a Python Virtual Environment?

A **virtual environment** is an isolated Python environment that allows you to install and manage dependencies for a specific project without interfering with global Python settings or other projects.

It includes its own Python binary and can have its own independent set of installed packages.

---

## ❓ Why Use a Python Virtual Environment?

- ✅ Avoid conflicts between package versions across projects
- ✅ Work on multiple Python projects with different dependencies
- ✅ Keep your system’s global Python environment clean
- ✅ Easily share and replicate environments via `requirements.txt`

---

## 🔧 Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 installed
- `python3-venv` package available
- Ubuntu system with internet access
- User must have `sudo` privileges

---

## 🧪 1. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
```

If you get an error like:

```bash
The virtual environment was not created successfully because ensurepip is not available.
```

Install the necessary package:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3.10-venv -y
```

---

## 🚀 2. Activate the Virtual Environment

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

You will see the environment name in your prompt:

```bash
(myenv) ubuntu@host:~$
```

---

## 📦 3. Install Packages

```bash
pip install requests flask
```

✔ Example output:
```
Successfully installed requests flask ...
```

---

## 📋 4. Freeze Installed Packages

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

✔ File will look like:
```
Flask==3.1.0
requests==2.32.3
...
```

---

## 🛑 5. Deactivate the Environment

```bash
deactivate
```

✔ You will exit the virtual environment.

---

## 🧹 6. Delete the Virtual Environment

```bash
rm -rf myenv
```

---

## ❗ Troubleshooting

### Error: `ensurepip is not available`

Install venv with:
```bash
sudo apt install python3.10-venv
```

### Error: `No installation candidate`

Run update first:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- **Always run `sudo apt update` before setting up venv**
- **Use a fresh environment for each project**
- **Use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to track dependencies**
- **Use `deactivate` before switching to another environment**
- **Remove unused environments with `rm -rf`**
